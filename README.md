Given parameters:

    q = 1.6e-19 [C]
    Ɛ = 1.0e-12 [F/cm]
    kT = 0.026 [eV] at 300K
    ni = 1.5e10 [/cm3] at 300K
    Mobility
     hole 500 [cm2/V-sec]
     Electron 1500 [cm2/V-sec]
    1[J] = 1[C] x 1[V]
    1[W] = 1[A] x 1[V]
    1[A] = 1[C] / 1[sec]
    C=dQ/dV
    
    E(critical) = 2e5 [V/cm]
    I_o = 10 [A]
    V_dc = 300 [V]

2.  Calculate on resistance of the MOSFET for area of 1 cm2
3.  Calculate Coss (CGD+CDS) as a function of applied voltage (Fig 2)
